#summary Install instruction for docnext server

= Required external tools =

Server needs some command-line tools described bellow
 * xpdf
 * xpdf-japanese
 * openoffice.org
 * ImageMagick

You should run openoffice.org as a daemon (performance reason), so, you should run shell-script on startup, like bellow
{{{
unset DISPLAY
/usr/lib/openoffice/program/soffice "-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;StarOffice.ServiceManager" -nologo -headless -nofirststartwizard

}}}

Of cource, you need to install application server like tomcat.

= Server setting =

You should specify server's parameter (DB, command-line tool's location, etc...) in config/config.(username).properties.

See the sample, config/config.tomcat6.properties
